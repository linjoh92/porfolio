                        <p>I’ve been freelancing as a creative consultant for the last five years. 
                            I have mostly done Art Director job and worked with graphic- and product design, marketing 
                            strategy, PR and digital content and company profiling.</p>
                        <p>I also have knowledge of “Facebook Ad Manager” and I have a great understanding 
                            for PR cam- paigns and how to plan them. I have a big artistic side and have 
                            done illustrations, taken photography, styled fashion and food for clients. I have 
                            education in fashion design and fashion buying and I have created an accessories 
                            brand called Hacéli.</p>
                        <p><span class="about-titel">BUT NOW</span> a new chapter in my life is starting, I´m studying at Changemaker Educations, 
                            Front end / App Developer. I´m loving it and feel for the first time in my working 
                            career that I´m satisfied. This is one hundred percent right for me, I am logical when 
                            it comes to numbers and my creativity is a great asset in programming. I love solving 
                            problems and am excited about what the future hold for me.</p>
