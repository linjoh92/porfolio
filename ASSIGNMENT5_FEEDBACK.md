Hi Linn!

It's been an absolute pleasure to look and assess your assignments, and I think this one takes the cake. It's an exceptional piece of work.

Although I'm only assessing the code, your nailed everything here - the design, the concepts, even the feel of it is first class.

20/10, Välgodkänt! 

I know you had some tough times studying while dealing with a small child, but throughout the course you've clearly shown you have the artistic ability and more importantly the determination to be a great developer. Well done. YOu should be really proud of what you have done.
